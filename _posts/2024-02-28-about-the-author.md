Hi there! I am Minwoo Seong, deeply engaged in the interplay between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Virtual Reality (VR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). My academic journey and professional endeavors are anchored in a commitment to utilize these technologies to enhance human experiences across diverse realms such as education, healthcare, and sports. Through an interdisciplinary lens, my aim is to explore the potential of technology to address complex societal challenges while fostering positive societal impacts.

Central to my research ethos is the conviction that technology should act as an enhancer of human capabilities, broadening the scope of what we can achieve. This guiding principle has been the foundation of my involvement in leading-edge projects like "Engagnition," dedicated to creating a multi-dimensional dataset for recognizing engagement in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, and "MultiSenseBadminton," which introduces a wearable sensor-based biomechanical dataset aimed at improving badminton performance. These initiatives highlight my commitment to using technology as a tool for social betterment, providing innovative solutions tailored to meet diverse needs.

My efforts to merge the physical and digital realms, particularly through projects like "ErgoPulse," underscore my dedication to enhancing the way humans interact with technology. By creating immersive VR environments, my goal is to establish a more intuitive interface between users and technology, where the augmentation of human potential is balanced with the essence of human experience.

Beyond my scholarly work, my involvement in copyright content creation and technological competitions speaks to my broad skill set and creative thinking. Whether it's designing immersive content for VR-based underwater exploration or analyzing future trends in sports performance, my projects span a broad spectrum, each aimed at pushing technological boundaries while staying connected to real-world applications.

At its core, my research and projects are driven by a singular goal: to advance the fields of HCI, VR, and AI in ways that not only deepen our engagement with technology but also contribute to a more inclusive and enriching future for everyone. Through ongoing exploration and innovation, I seek to uncover new paths where technology acts as a catalyst for positive transformation, enhancing lives and broadening the scope of human experiences.
