Hi there! I'm Minwoo Seong. I have a background in mechanical engineering and am in the process of completing a master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction in Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology. I'm excited to share my knowledge and contents with you. Check out [my personal website](https://dailyminiii.github.io/) for more information on my other projects, as well as some of my writing.
