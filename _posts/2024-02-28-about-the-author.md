Welcome to my personal homepage! I'm Minwoo Seong, deeply passionate about exploring the exciting world of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Virtual Reality (VR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). My journey in these fields is driven by a simple yet profound goal: to use technology to make our lives better, especially in education, music, healthcare, and sports. Here, you'll find a blend of my academic pursuits, creative projects, and a snapshot of my contributions to both the technological and artistic communities.

Envisioning a Human-Centered Technological Horizon
</strong></p></div>
  
<div style="font-size: 18px;"><p>
My studies have led me to the exciting crossroads of HCI, VR, and AI, where I've had the amazing opportunity to work alongside renowned groups like MIT's CSAIL. This collaboration has greatly enhanced my research, enabling me to embark on innovative projects aimed at improving how we interact with technology. From developing datasets to better understand how children with Autism Spectrum Disorder engage with their surroundings, to designing wearable sensor systems that boost sports performance, my focus is on harnessing technology for positive impact.

Right now, I'm especially drawn to using AI to help beginners in sports. This involves setting up virtual training spaces and showing the differences between the movements people want to make and what they actually do. My goal is to use VR and AI to transform sports training into something that's not only more reachable and efficient but also more captivating.

Notes from the Heart: Bridging Personal Passion with Musical Exploration
</strong></p></div>
  
<div style="font-size: 18px;"><p>
Outside of my research work, music, especially playing the piano, is very important to me. I love diving into music, whether that’s creating new tunes, playing jazz pieces, or producing music. This passion isn’t just about playing music; it shows how much I enjoy mixing technology with music to make something special for the ears.
</p></div>

<div style="font-size: 18px;"><p>
I don’t just play music; I also love listening to it. This hobby is made even better by my interest in using technology to make listening to music an even better experience. I’m always curious about how technology can make enjoying music better, making it feel more real and immersive. This drive shows my dedication to using new tech to make music more enjoyable for everyone, proving that technology can really make our experience of music richer and more interesting.

<div style="font-size: 18px;"><p>
As AI gets better, it’s really interesting to see it being used in areas we usually think of as very human, like art and music. This makes us wonder about what being creative really means and how art might change in the future. Just like how cameras started new kinds of art and MIDI changed how we make music, AI is going to make a big difference too. I’m excited to figure out what all this means for being creative and how artists can use AI to take their work to new levels.

A Vision for Multisensory Artistic Experiences:
</strong></p></div>

<div style="font-size: 18px;"><p>
I dream of a future where new tech, especially in virtual spaces, changes how we see art and music. Picture not just hearing music, but feeling it with all your senses, in a space where you can touch and move around the sounds. Also, mixing VR, AR, and touch-based tech could make art something you can step into and interact with, giving us totally new ways to enjoy and connect with visuals.

A Vision for the Future:
</strong></p></div>
  
<div style="font-size: 18px;"><p>
At the heart of what I do is the idea that technology should help make things better, improving our lives and making our experiences richer. I'm always looking for new ways to use technology to connect us more deeply with the digital world and to create a future that's welcoming, interesting, and full of life for everyone.
