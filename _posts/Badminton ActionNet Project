This project proposes a new dataset of biomechanical data for two essential strokes in badminton: the overhead clear and the backhand drive. The dataset comprises approximately 3750 instances of each stroke, collected using multiple wearable sensors, including eye tracking, body tracking, electromyography, and insole pressure sensors. Notably, the dataset includes annotations for stroke type, expert level, hitting sound, ball landing position, and hitting position, providing a comprehensive and accurate collection of data. The dataset was collected from a diverse range of skill levels, including twelve beginners, eight intermediates, and five experts, making it a valuable resource for coaches and players. It enables them to develop and enhance training and coaching techniques, as well as facilitate the development of more sophisticated analysis and training tools. Ultimately, the dataset has the potential to improve player performance and training outcomes, and provide a deeper understanding of the biomechanics of these fundamental strokes in badminton.
